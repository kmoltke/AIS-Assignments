## Problem 1: Basis of Trust

### Part 1
`<B, ax, Amasoft Inc.>`
- Unreasonable because there is no proof that Amasoft Inc. is trustworthy.
### Part 2
`<B, ax, Amasoft Inc.>`, `<T, an, me>`
- Somewhat reasonable assuming I can comprehend ALL reasonable inputs (i.e. the program is fairly simple).
### Part 3
`<B, ax, Amasoft Inc.>`, `<P, an, V>`, `<V, ax, me>`
- Pretty unreasonable since I blindly trust the third-party analytical program. However, if I have analyzed V to be a trustworthy program (i.e. `<V, an, me>`) then it would be somewhat reasonable.
### Part 4
`<B, ax, Amasoft Inc.>`, `<P, an, V>`, `<V, an, me>`
- This is reasonable since I have analyzed the third-party program and then uses it to verify `P` (i.e. this is kinda transitive).
### Part 5
`<B, ax, Amasoft Inc.>`, `<B, sy, B'>`, `<B', ax, me>`
- This is unreasonable since I blindly trust the trustworthiness of the third-party program, `B'`
### Part 6
`<A, an, M>`, `<M, sy, compiler>`, `<compiler(writer), ax, me>`, `<`
### Part 7
### Part 8
### Part 9
